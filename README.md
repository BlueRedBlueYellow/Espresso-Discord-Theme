## What is this theme? 
Project Garrison is a soft and fluffy Discord theme with a very liberal interpretation of Material Design guidelines.

The work-in-progress name stems from the fact that I started development on this theme while I was vacationing in Garrison, NY. I'll come up with a real name for this theme later. Probably something lame as hell like "Marshmallow" or  "Creamy" or "Creamallow" or idk I'll figure it out fuck you. 


## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

Holy cow, this theme is NOT finished. Do *not* use this with the expectations of shit working the way you want it to. 
 * ‚ÄºÔ∏è Want to help? Submit a pull request. My apologies in advance for the .css being unorganized and messy.  

## How to use üìñ

### Discord App

### Discord Website
