## What is this theme? ü§î
Project Garrison is a soft and fluffy Discord theme with a very liberal interpretation of Material Design guidelines.

The work-in-progress name stems from the fact that I started development on this theme while I was vacationing in Garrison, NY. I'll come up with a real name for this theme later. Probably something lame as hell like "Marshmallow" or  "Creamy" or "Creamallow" or idk I'll figure it out fuck you. 


# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

Holy cow, this theme is NOT finished. Do *not* use this with the expectations of shit working the way you want it to. 
 * ‚ÄºÔ∏è Want to help? Submit a pull request. My apologies in advance for the .css being unorganized and messy.  

## How to use üìñ

### Discord App

* Use a Discord modification such as [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord), [Openasar](https://openasar.dev/), or [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord) that allows for CSS injection

### Discord Website

* Use a CSS injecting extension such as [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), and then click [here](https://github.com/SlippingGittys-Discord-Themes/ProjectGarrison/raw/main/projectgarrison.user.css) and press "Install style".
