## What is this theme? ü§î
Honestly, even I'm still trying to figure this out! üíÄ Clearly there is a direct insperation from Material Design v3... Material Symbols & Product Sans and all, but I'm being a little liberal with shadows and shapes as well. I honestly don't know what I desire from this theme. Just something soft on the eyes, and plenty of room for user hackability. I'll work on constructing that part later. 

The work-in-progress name stems from the fact that I started development on this theme when I was vacationing in Garrison, NY. I'll come up with a real name for this theme later. Probably something gay like "Marshmallow" or  "Creamy" or "Creamallow" or idk I'll figure it out fuck you


# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

Holy cow, this theme is NOT finished. Not only is it unfinished, it just sucks. It fucking sucks. Do *not* use this with the expectations of shit working the way you want it to. Want to help? Submit a pull request. My apologies in advanced for the .css being unorganized and messy.
